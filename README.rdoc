== TO RUN

To run the scrape, run rails server and then go to localhost:3000/search

Updates
Monday, 17 Nov - adding map functionality
Tuesday, 18 Nov - 12:45 AM - map markers not appearing. Blocked from yelp. Will try again tomorrow morning using Hotspot Shield

** Note - You still have to manually enter in the location data (/app/services/search.rb:9). Working on scraping location options and eventually to add in a search and/or using Mechanize to allow for searching
